= Test Execution

For our SDP Pipeline Libraries, tests are placed in a directory called `unit-tests` within the library directory.

== Executing tests with Gradle

This repo has been set up to run Jenkins-Spock tests using Gradle.

From the root of the sdp-libraries repository, run `make test`.

== Executing tests with Docker

The unit tests can also be executed via Docker.  From the root of the sdp-libraries repository, run `make test docker`.

== Viewing Test Results

Spock will create an HTML test report.  After running tests, you can run `open target/reports/tests/test/index.html`.
