= Test Execution

For our SDP Pipeline Libraries, tests are placed in a directory called `unit-tests` within the library directory.

== Executing tests with Docker

The unit tests can be executed inside of a Docker container.  From the root of the sdp-libraries repository, run `make test docker`.

== Executing tests with Gradle

The unit tests can be executed using your installation of Gradle, assuming it's a compatible version (4.10.2 and 6.3.0 have been tested) and it's been properly configured. To run all of the tests, run `gradle test` from the root of the sdp-libraries repository. To run individual test classes, append the `--tests` flag followed by the class name in quotes, ex. `gradle test --tests "SlackSpec"`. You can add multiple `--tests` flags to run a set of test classes.

== Viewing Test Results

Spock will create an HTML test report.  After running tests, you can run `open target/reports/tests/test/index.html`.
