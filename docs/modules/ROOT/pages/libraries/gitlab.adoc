= Gitlab

This library is unique in that rather than provide functional step implementations, it provides methods that help with the business logic defined within pipeline templates.

[NOTE]
====
It also provides additional functionality that can be useful for library developers to get scm metadata or interact with a remote gitlab repository.

== Pipeline Template Business Logic

The Gitlab library contributes some helper methods to help with pipeline template orchestration.  You can achieve fine grained control over what happens when in response to different Gitlab events such as commits, merge requests, and merges.

.Gitlab Flow Helper Methods
|===
| Method | Build Cause

| on_commit
| A direct commit to a branch

| on_merge_request
| A merge request was created or a developer pushed a commit to the source branch

| on_change
| A combination of `on_commit` and `on_merge_request`

| on_merge
| A merge request was merged into the branch.

|===

These methods take named parameters `to` and `from` indicating direction of the gitlab whose value is a regular expression to compare the branch names against.

SDP provides some default keywords for branch name regular expressions:

.Default Branch Regular Expressions
|===
| Keyword | Regular Expression

| master
| /^[Mm]aster$/

| develop
| /^[Dd]evelop(ment|er|)$/

| hotfix
| /^[Hh]ot[Ff]ix-/

| release
| /^[Rr]elease-(d+.)*d$/

|===

[NOTE]
====
These branch name regular expressions are not a part of the Gitlab library but rather leveraged by defining Keywords in the Pipeline Configuration File

== Example Pipeline Templates


*Full example using keywords*

[source,groovy]
----
on_commit{
  continuous_integration()
}

on_merge_request to: develop, {
  continuous_integration()
  deploy_to dev
  parallel "508 Testing": { accessibility_compliance_test() },
          "Functional Testing": { functional_test() },
          "Penetration Testing": { penetration_test() }
  deploy_to staging
  performance_test()
}

on_merge to: master, from: develop, {
  deploy_to prod
  smoke_test()
}
----

*Example using regular expressions directly*

[source,groovy]
----
on_commit to: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, {
  // will be triggered on feature branches
}
on_merge_request from: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, to: develop, {
  // will be triggered on MR's from feature to develop
}
----

*Example using on_change*

[source,groovy]
----
on_change{
  // do CI on every commit or MR
  continuous_integration()
}
on_merge_request to: master, {
  // do some stuff on MR to master
}
on_merge to: master, {
  // MR was merged into master
}
