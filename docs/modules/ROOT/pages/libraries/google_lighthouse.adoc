= Google Lighthouse 

This library integrates https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse[Google Lighthouse] to scan a frontend application for performance, accessibility compliance, search engine optimization, and best practice violations. 

The great part about this library is that developers can also use Google Lighthouse when developing locally in Chrome and these practices can be enforced via the pipeline.
