= GitHub Enterprise

This library is unique in that rather than provide functional step implementations, it provides methods that help with the business logic
defined within pipeline templates.

[NOTE]
====
It also provides additional functionality that can be useful for library developers to get scm metadata or interact with a remote github repository.

== Pipeline Template Business Logic

The GitHub Enterprise library contributes some helper methods to help with pipeline template orchestration.  You can achieve fine grained control over what happens when in response to different GitHub events such as commits, pull requests, and merges.

.GitHub Flow Helper Methods
|===
| Method | Build Cause

| on_commit
| A direct commit to a branch

| on_pull_request
| A pull request was created or a developer pushed a commit to the source branch

| on_merge
| A pull request was merged into the branch.

| on_change
| A combination of `on_commit` and `on_pull_request`

|===

These methods take named parameters `to` and `from` indicating direction of the github whose value is a regular expression to compare the branch names against.

SDP provides some default keywords for branch name regular expressions:

.Default Branch Regular Expressions
|===
| Keyword | Regular Expression

| master
| /^[Mm]aster$/

| develop
| /^[Dd]evelop(ment|er|)$/

| hotfix
| /^[Hh]ot[Ff]ix-/

| release
| /^[Rr]elease-(d+.)*d$/
 
|===

[NOTE]
====
These branch name regular expressions are not a part of the GitHub Enterprise library but rather leveraged by defining Keywords in the Pipeline configuration file

== Example Pipeline Templates

*Full example using keywords*

[source,groovy]
----
on_commit{
  continuous_integration()
}

on_pull_request to: develop, {
  continuous_integration()
  deploy_to dev
  parallel "508 Testing": { accessibility_compliance_test() },
          "Functional Testing": { functional_test() },
          "Penetration Testing": { penetration_test() }
  deploy_to staging
  performance_test()
}

on_merge to: master, from: develop, {
  deploy_to prod
  smoke_test()
}
----

*Example using regular expressions directly*

[source,groovy]
----
on_commit to: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, {
  // will be triggered on feature branches
}
on_pull_request from: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, to: develop, {
  // will be triggered on PR's from feature to develop
}
----

*Example using on_change*

[source,groovy]
----
on_change{
  // do CI on every commit or PR
  continuous_integration()
}
on_pull_request to: master, {
  // do some stuff on PR to master
}
on_merge to: master, {
  // PR was merged into master
}
