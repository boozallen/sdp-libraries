= Docker

The Docker library will build docker images and push them into a docker repository.

== Steps Contributed

.Steps
|===
| *Step* | *Description* 

| ``build()``
| builds a container image, tagging it with the Git SHA, and pushes the image to the defined registry

| ``get_images_to_build()``
| inspects the source code repository based upon the configured ``build_strategy`` to determine which container images to build

| ``login_to_registry()``
| logs in to the configured container registry

| ``retag()``
| retags the container images determined by ``get_images_to_build()`` 

|===

== Example Configuration Snippet

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  docker {
     build_strategy = "dockerfile"
     registry = "docker-registry.default.svc:5000"
     cred = "openshift-docker-registry"
     repo_path_prefix = "proj-images"
     remove_local_image = true
  }
}

== Configurations

.Docker Configuration Options
|===
| Field | Description | Default Value | Required

| build_strategy
| Sets how the library will build the container image(s); Must be dockerfile, docker-compose, or modules
| dockerfile
| false

| registry
| Where the container images produced during the pipeline builds are going to be pushed to
| 
| true

| cred
| Credentials used for the repository where different docker pipeline tools are stored.
| 
| true

| repo_path_prefix
| The part of the repository name between the registry name and the last forward-slash
| ""
| false

| remove_local_image
| Determines if the pipeline should remove the local image after building or retagging
| false
| false

|===

== External Dependencies

* A Docker registry must be set up and configured. Credentials to the repository are also needed.
* Either the github or github_enterprise library needs to be loaded as a library inside your pipeline_config.groovy file.
