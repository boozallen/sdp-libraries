= SDP

The SDP library provides helper steps used by multiple libraries within sdp-libraries.

== Steps Provided

.Steps
|===
| Step | Description

| ``inside_sdp_images(String image, Closure body)``
| helper function that wraps ``docker.image(<image>).inside{}`` to execute a portion of the pipeline inside the specified container image runtime environment

| ``jteVersion``
| a multi-method step that provides utilities for determining the current JTE version. more docs below. 

|===

.Lifecycle Hooks
|===
| Step | Hook | Purpose 

| archive_pipeline_config()
| `@Init`
| Writes the aggregated pipeline configuration to a file and saves it as a build artifact

| create_workspace_stash()
| `@Validate`
| If the pipeline job is a Multibranch Project, checkout the source code.  In either case, save a stash called "workspace" for other libraries to consume. 

|===

== Library Configuration Options

.SDP Library Configuration Options
|===
| Field | Description | Default Value

| images.registry
| This sets the registry the sdp library expects to find its Docker images
| 

| images.repository
| The first https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-registry-v2-spec-and-repository-naming-rule/5466[path component] in the repository name, e.g. if your images follow the format ``my-registry.com/sdp/*``, this would be *sdp*
|

| sdp.images.cred
| Credentials used for the repository where different docker pipeline tools are stored
| 

| sdp.images.docker_args
| Arguments to use when starting the container. Uses the same flags as `docker run`
| 

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike the Docker Library, the value in "registry" _does_ include the protocol (http/https)
====

== Example Configuration Snippet

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  sdp{
    images{
      registry = "https://docker.pkg.github.com" <1>
      repository = "boozallen/sdp-images" <2>
      cred = "github" <3>
    }
  }
}
----
<1> the container registry that holds the SDP container images
<2> the container image repository that holds the SDP container images
<3> A jenkins credential ID to authenticate to the container registry

== `jteVersion`

`jteVersion` is a multi-method step that provides utilities for determining the current JTE version. This is particularly useful when making changes to support backwards compatibility. 

.Methods
|===
| Method | Description

| `jteVersion.get()`
| returns the current JTE version

| `jteVersion.lessThan(String version)`
| returns true if the current JTE version is less than the parameter

| `jteVersion.lessThanOrEqualTo(String version)`
| returns true if the current JTE version is less than or equal to the parameter

| `jteVersion.greatherThan(String version)`
| returns true if the current JTE version is greater than the parameter

| `jteVersion.greaterThanOrEqualTo(String version)`
| returns true if the current JTE version is greater than or equal to the parameter

| `jteVersion.equalTo(String version)`
| returns true if the current JTE version is equal to the parameter

|===

For example, 

[source, groovy]
----
if (jteVersion.lessThan("2.1")){
  // code to run if current installed version is < 2.1
} else { 
  // code to run if current installed version is >= 2.1
}
----

== External Dependencies

* A Docker registry must be setup and configured. Credentials to the registry are also needed.
* A repository for the image being used by the given library is expected to be in the given registry.
* The repository name for the pipeline tools' images should be in the format  _"${images.registry}/${images.repository}/tool-name"_
* The Pipeline Utility Steps plugin is required
