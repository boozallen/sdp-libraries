= Sysdig Secure

This library leverages Sysdig Secure's https://github.com/sysdiglabs/secure-inline-scan[inline scanning script] to scan container images, report the information to the Sysdig Secure server, and download a PDF report of the findings.

== Results

The `scan_container_images()` step will generate a PDF report of the scan if the upload to the Sysdig Secure API is successful.  link:{attachmentsdir}/sysdig_secure/sysdig_secure_report.pdf[Here's an example]. 

== External Dependencies 

This library, by nature of the inline scanning script, requires that:

* a running docker daemon is available 
* internet access to pull an image from docker.io/anchore/inline-scan

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, this library could be expanded to pass a custom image to perform the scanning, perhaps helpful if proxying through a local registry, by setting the environment variable `SYSDIG_CI_IMAGE` as part of the command invocation.
