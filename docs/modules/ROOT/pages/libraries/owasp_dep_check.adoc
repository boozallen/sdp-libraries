= OWASP Dependency Check

The OWASP Dependency Check library will use the namesake tool to scan a project's source code to identify components with known vulnerabilities.

==  Example Configuration Snippet


[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  owasp_dep_check {
    scan_target = "src"
    cvss_threshold = "9"
  }
}
----

== Viewing The Reports

By default, the static_dependency_check_analysis step outputs the results of its analysis in multiple formats: HTML, JSON, XML, and CSV. It also outputs an abbreviated report in HTML that contains just the detected vulnerabilities.

You can view these reports in the "Artifacts" tab of the build in the Blue Ocean View. In the standard Jenkins view, at the "Stage View", you can view the reports by clicking on the small blue arrow to the left of the build's progress bar.

== CVSS Threshold & Scores

From the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System[Wikipedia article], "The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities ... Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe"

The pipeline has the ability to fail if vulnerability is detected at or above a given threshold. This threshold is set with the "cvss_threshold" configuration option. For example, if cvss_threshold is set to 7, and a vulnerabily with a CVSS score of 7.5 is detected, the pipeline will fail. If the vulnerability remains, but the cvss_threshold is set to 9, the pipeline will pass the OWASP Dependency Check scan.

If you wish for the scan to pass regardless of the CVSS scores of detected vulnerabilities, you may set cvss_threshold to a number higher than 10 or to "pass". For example:

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  owasp_dep_check {
    cvss_threshold = "pass"
  }
}
