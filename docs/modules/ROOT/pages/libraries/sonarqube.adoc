= SonarQube

SonarQube is a tool used for *static code analysis*. Static code analysis is validating code as-written against industry standard practices.  It will help you find best practice violations and potential security vulnerabilities.

Organizations can define Quality Profiles which are custom rule profiles that projects must use.  Quality Gates are then rules defining the organizational policies for code quality. SDP will, by default, fail the build if the Quality Gate fails.

== Example Configuration Snippet

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  sonarqube{
    credential_id = "sonarqube"
  }
}

== Sonar Scanner Configurations

Extra configuration options are available by leveraging SonarQube's https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters[sonar-project.properties] file. the sonar-project.properties file should be added to root of the source repositoy.

==  External Dependencies

* SonarQube must already be deployed. Reference the deployment script for SDP.
* Jenkins must have a credential to access SonarQube, this is done by default when using the deployment script.
* The SonarQube URL must be configured in `Manage Jenkins > Configure System`
