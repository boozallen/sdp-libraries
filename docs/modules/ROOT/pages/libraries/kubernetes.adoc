== Library Configurations

The configurations for the Kubernetes library can be specified in the library spec or on a per application environment.

===  Kubernetes Credential and Context


The Kubernetetes Credential is the Jenkins credential defined as a Secrets file that holds the kubeconfig fie contents with access information to the kubernetes target environments. The Kubernetes Context is the context within the kubeconfig that should be used to identify the target environment for deployment.

You would specify this as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
  dev{
    short_name = "dev"
    long_name = "Development"
  }
  test{
    short_name = "test"
    long_name = "Test"
    k8s_context = "test"
  }
  prod{
    short_name = "prod"
    long_name = "Production"
    k8s_credential = "cluster1-config"
    k8s_context = "production"
  }
}
libraries{
  kubernetes{
    k8s_credential = "cluster2-config"
    k8s_context = "dev"
  }
}
----

With this configuration, `dev` context within the  `cluster2-config` would be used when deploying to `dev` and the `test` context within the  `cluster2-config` would be used when deploying to  `test` while `production` context within the `cluster1-config` would be used when deploying to `prod`. Together k8s_credential and k8s_context uniquely identify the target environment for deployment.

=== Helm Configuration


We use https://helm.sh/[Helm] for a deployment mechanism to Kubernetes.  Helm is a package manager and templating engine for Kubernetes manifests.  Using Helm, the typical YAML manifests used to deploy to Kubernetes distributions can be templatized for reuse.  In our case, a different values file is used for each static application environment.

*Create Helm Configuration Repository*

You'll need to create a GitHub repository to store the helm chart for your application(s). See the https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-create[helm docs on provisioning a new chart] to get intialize the repository with the skeleton for your chart.

How you choose to build your helm chart is up to you, you can put every api object in the `templates` directory or have subcharts for each individual microservice.  SDP doesn't care, as all it does is clone the github repository and deploy the chart using the specified values file.

*Values File Conventions*

Given that we tag container images using the git SHA, SDP will clone your helm configuration repository and update a key corresponding to the current version of each container image for each application environment.

As such, a certain syntax is required in your values file.  You must have an `image_shas` key. SDP will automatically add subkeys for each repositories under this `image_shas` with a value that is the git SHA.

[NOTE]
====
Given that YAML keys can't have hyphens, hyphens in repository names will be replaced with underscores.
====

[source,groovy]
----
image_shas:
  my_sample_application: abcdefgh
  another_repo: abcdef
----

you can add whatever other keys are necessary to appropriately parameterize your helm chart.

*Helm Configurations for the Library*

The helm configuration repository and github credential can be configured globally in the library spec and overriden for specific application environments.

The values file to will default to `values.${app_env.short_name}.yaml`, or can be overridden via `app_env.chart_values_file`.

The name of the release will default to `app_env.short_name`, or can be overridden via `app_env.release_name`

An example of helm configurations:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
  dev{
    short_name = "dev"
    long_name = "Development"
    chart_values_file = "dev_values.yaml"
  }
  test{
    short_name = "test"
    long_name = "Test"
    release_name = "banana"

  }
  prod{
    short_name = "prod"
    long_name = "Production"
  }
}
libraries{
  kubernetes{
    helm_configuration_repository = "https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git"
    helm_configuration_repository_credential = "github"
  }
}
----

=== Promoting Images

It's often beneficial to build a container image once, and then promote that image through different application environments. This makes it possible to test the content of an image once in a lower environment, and remain confident that the results of those tests would be the same as an image is promoted. Promoting images also speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, as building a container image is often the most time-consuming part of the pipeline.

By default, the `deploy_to()` step of the kubernetes pipeline library will promote a container image if it can expect one to exist, which is when the most recent code change was a *merge* into the given code branch. The image would be expected to be built from an earlier commit, or while there was an open PR.

You can override this default for the entire pipeline by setting the `promote_previous_image` config setting to *false*. You can also choose whether or not to promote  images for each application environment individually through the `promote_previous_image` application_environment setting. This app_env setting takes priority over the config setting.

An example of these settings' usage:

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
  dev{
    short_name = "dev"
    long_name = "Development"
    promote_previous_image = false
  }
  prod{
    short_name = "prod"
    long_name = "Production"
  }
}
libraries{
  kubernetes{
    helm_configuration_repository = "https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git"
    helm_configuration_repository_credential = "github"
    k8s_credential = "cluster1-config"
    k8s_context = "staging"
    promote_previous_image = true //note: making this setting true is redundant, since true is the default
  }
}
