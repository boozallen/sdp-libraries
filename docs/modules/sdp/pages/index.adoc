= SDP

The SDP library provides helper steps used by multiple libraries within sdp-libraries.

== Steps Provided

.Steps
|===
| Step | Description

| ``inside_sdp_images(String image, Closure body)``
| helper function that wraps ``docker.image(<image>).inside{}`` to execute a portion of the pipeline inside the specified container image runtime environment

|===

== Library Configuration Options

.SDP Library Configuration Options
|===
| Field | Description | Default Value

| images.registry
| This sets the registry the sdp library expects to find its Docker images
| 

| images.repository
| The first https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-registry-v2-spec-and-repository-naming-rule/5466[path component] in the repository name, e.g. if your images follow the format ``my-registry.com/sdp/*``, this would be *sdp*

| sdp.images.cred
| Credentials used for the repository where different docker pipeline tools are stored
| 

| sdp.images.docker_args
| Arguments to use when starting the container. Uses the same flags as `docker run`
| 

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike the Docker Library, the value in "registry" _does_ include the protocol (http/https)

== Example Configuration Snippet

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
  sdp{
    images{
      registry = "https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000"
      repository = "sdp"
      cred = "openshift-docker-registry"
      docker_args = ""
    }
  }
}

== External Dependencies

* A Docker registry must be setup and configured. Credentials to the registry are also needed.
* A repository for the image being used by the given library is expected to be in the given registry.
* The repository name for the pipeline tools' images should be in the format  _"${images.registry}/${images.repository}/tool-name"_
