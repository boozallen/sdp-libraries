= SDP Pipeline Libraries

This repository contains https://boozallen.com[Booz Allen's] pipeline libraries that integrate with the https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine/[Jenkins Templating Engine].

If you want to learn more, the best place to get started is the https://boozallen.github.io/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/latest/index.html[documentation]. 

== Repository Structure

=== Libraries

The libraries themselves can be found under the `libraries` directory.  Each subdirectory corresponds to the name of the library, and the basename of the groovy files held within are the `steps` contributed by that library. 

=== Unit Tests

The SDP Pipeline Libraries leverage https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/jenkins-spock[Jenkins Spock] as a unit testing framework for testing the library steps.  

Each library that has unit tests has a subdirectory under `test` containing the individual Specification files for the library. 

To execute the unit tests, run `make test`. 

=== Documentation 

https://antora.org[Antora] is used as the documentation framework.  For each library you'll find an AsciiDoc file under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages` that outlines the steps contributed by the library, how to configure the library in your pipeline configuration file, what types of artifacts are generated, and any external dependencies the library may have.  

To build the documentation run `make docs`.  You can then open `docs/html/index.html` to view the generated documentation.
